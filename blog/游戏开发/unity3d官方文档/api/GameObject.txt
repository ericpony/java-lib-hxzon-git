Constructors

GameObject	Creates a new game object, named name.

----
Functions

AddComponent	Adds a component class named className to the game object.

BroadcastMessage	Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object or any of its children.

CompareTag	Is this game object tagged with tag?

GetComponent	Returns the component of Type type if the game object has one attached, null if it doesn't. You can access both builtin components or scripts with this function.

GetComponentInChildren	Returns the component of Type type in the GameObject or any of its children using depth first search.

GetComponents	Returns all components of Type type in the GameObject.

GetComponentsInChildren	Returns all components of Type type in the GameObject or any of its children.

SampleAnimation	Samples an animation at a given time for any animated properties.

SendMessage	Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object.

SendMessageUpwards	Calls the method named methodName on every MonoBehaviour in this game object and on every ancestor of the behaviour.

SetActive	Activates/Deactivates the GameObject.
激活或取消激活本游戏对象。

----
Static Functions

CreatePrimitive	Creates a game object with a primitive mesh renderer and appropriate collider.
（appropriate，适当的。）
创建一个游戏对象，带有基本网格渲染器和适当的碰撞体。

Find	Finds a game object by name and returns it.
根据name查找指定游戏对象。

FindGameObjectsWithTag	Returns a list of active GameObjects tagged tag. Returns empty array if no GameObject was found.
根据tag查找游戏对象，只限已激活，返回列表。

FindWithTag	Returns one active GameObject tagged tag. Returns null if no GameObject was found.
根据tag查找游戏对象，只限已激活，且只返回一个。

====
Inherited members

Variables

hideFlags	Should the object be hidden, saved with the scene or modifiable by the user?
name	The name of the object.

----
Functions

GetInstanceID	Returns the instance id of the object.
ToString	Returns the name of the game object.
Static Functions
Destroy	Removes a gameobject, component or asset.
DestroyImmediate	Destroys the object obj immediately. You are strongly recommended to use Destroy instead.
DontDestroyOnLoad	Makes the object target not be destroyed automatically when loading a new scene.
FindObjectOfType	Returns the first active loaded object of Type type.
FindObjectsOfType	Returns a list of all active loaded objects of Type type.
Instantiate	Clones the object original and returns the clone.

----
Operators

bool	Does the object exist?
operator !=	Compares if two objects refer to a different object.
operator ==	Compares if two objects refer to the same.
