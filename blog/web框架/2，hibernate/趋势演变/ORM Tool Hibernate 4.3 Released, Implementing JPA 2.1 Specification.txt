The final version of Hibernate ORM 4.3, a Java-based Object-Relational Mapping, ORM, framework, was recently released, 
bringing support for stored procedures and entity graphs. 
支持存储过程和实体图。

Hibernate 4.3 is a certified implementation of the JPA 2.1 Specification, JSR 338, released in May 2013.
实现了jpa2.1规范。

Main focus for this release has been on support for the JPA 2.1 specification and the new features defined which include:
主要重点是支持jpa2.1规范和以下新特性：

Standardized support for working with stored procedure and function calls, across both providers and database vendors.
存储过程和函数调用的标准化，跨数据库平台。

Definition and execution of UPDATE and DELETE queries can now be made in a type-safe way.
定义和执行update和delete语句，现在是类型安全的。

Entity listeners, for implementing lifecycle events in separate classes, 
may now use the CDI standard, (JSR-299), for injection of dependencies.
实体监听器，在单独的类中实现，可以使用CDI标准。

AttributeConverters, 
which enable conversions of basic values between the representation in the database and in the corresponding objects.
属性转换，将基本值转成数据库的表示，或者相反。

Entity Graphs for defining how an entity and its sub-elements are loaded. 
How a graph is loaded may also be changed dynamically.
实体图，用来定义一个实体和它的子元素如何加载，可以动态改变加载方式。

A standardized way of how schema generation is performed across providers together 
with a baseline of configuration settings all providers understand.
如何创建数据库表，标准化。

Synchronization of persistence context with the current transaction can now be controlled via SynchronizationType.
当前事务的持久上下文的同步，可以使用SynchronizationType控制。

An object can now be constructed using argument values 
returned from a SQL query by using the @ConstructorResult annotation.
可以使用@ConstructorResult注解，从一个sql原生查询返回的参数值，来构建对象。

Other significant changes, not related to the new JPA specification, include:
和jpa规范无关的改变，如下：

Increased support for OSGi environments. 
The plan is to further improve the support in Hibernate 5.
支持osgi环境。

Support for inline dirty checking, finding which entities state has changed, 
based on new bytecode enhancement support within Hibernate.
支持内联肮脏检查，基于字节码增强。

Documentation has been updated to correspond with the new version.
