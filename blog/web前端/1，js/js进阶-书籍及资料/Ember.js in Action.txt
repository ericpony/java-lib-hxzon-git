DESCRIPTION

Modern web applications look and perform like desktop apps. They're secure, scalable, and fast. They provide rich UIs that adapt seamlessly to mobile environments. In a word, they're ambitious. Ember.js is a JavaScript-driven framework designed to help you build ambitious web applications. By automatically incorporating the idioms and best practices that define all modern web apps, Ember helps you focus on the unique aspects of your project. Ember's APIs are easy to understand and use, and it's designed from the ground up with developer productivity in mind.

Ember.js in Action is a crisp tutorial that introduces the Ember.js framework and shows you how to build production-quality web applications. You'll begin with the basic architecture: client- and server-side MVC, integrating Ember.js with your favorite backend, handling data, and more. You'll explore the amazing Handelbars templating engine that automatically updates your apps when the data behind them changes. Along the way, you'll develop a complete Ember.js application and learn how to deploy, administer, and update it efficiently.
