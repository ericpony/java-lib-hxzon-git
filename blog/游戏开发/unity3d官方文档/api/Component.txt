Component
http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Component.html

Namespace: UnityEngine
Parent class: Object

Description
Base class for everything attached to GameObjects.
所有可附加到游戏对象上的类的基类。

Note that your code will never directly create a Component. 
Instead, you write script code, and attach the script to a GameObject. 
See Also: ScriptableObject as a way to create scripts that do not attach to any GameObject.
参见“可脚本对象”，不附加到任何游戏对象。
