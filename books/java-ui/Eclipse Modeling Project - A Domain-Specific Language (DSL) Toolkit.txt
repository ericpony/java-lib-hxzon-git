Achieve Breakthrough Productivity and Quality with MDD and Eclipse-Based DSLs

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) and model-driven development (MDD) offer software engineers powerful new ways to improve productivity, enhance quality, and insulate systems from rapid technological change. Now, there’s a pragmatic, start-to-finish guide to creating DSLs and using MDD techniques with the powerful open source Eclipse platform. In Eclipse Modeling Project, Richard C. Gronback illuminates both the principles and techniques software professionals need to master, offering insights that will be invaluable to developers working with any tool or platform.

As coleader of the Eclipse Modeling Project, Gronback is singularly well-positioned to demonstrate DSLs and MDD at work in Eclipse. Gronback systematically introduces each of the Eclipse technologies that can be used in DSL and MDD development. Throughout, he introduces key concepts and technologies in the context of a complete worked example and presents new best practices and never-before published techniques. He also covers Eclipse projects discussed in no other book, including Query/View/Transformation (QVT) and the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF)–a project the author personally leads.

Eclipse Modeling Project gives software practitioners all the knowledge they need to explore the remarkable potential of DSLs and MDD–and includes coverage of

    Why a model-based approach enables the rapid customization of high-quality solutions within the product line paradigm
    How the Eclipse Modeling Project’s capabilities can be used to efficiently create new DSLs
    Powerful techniques for developing DSL abstract syntax, graphical notation, and textual syntax
    How to build Model-to-Model (M2M) and Model-to-Text (M2T) transformations–including a powerful new M2M implementation of the Object Management Group’s QVT Operational Mapping Language (OML)
    Efficiently packaging and deploying DSLs with Eclipse
    Complete reference sections for the Graphical Editing Framework (GEF), GMF runtime and tooling, QVT OML, Xpand, and more
