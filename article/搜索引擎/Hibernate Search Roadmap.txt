This is written to share our best effort intentions. 
Priorities might need to change, and your feedback will affect the roadmap.
Especially if you help in some area, we can make it happen quicker.
 
You're welcome do discuss this on our mailing list https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/hibernate-dev or on IRC (freenode #hibernate-dev - requires a registered account).

===========
Hibernate Search 4.3

Spatial features maturity
Better integration with EAP 6.1 (Infinispan, Hibernate ORM, JGroups versions aligned)
Improve clustering: better Infinispan and JGroups integration, ease of setup
改进集群：更好的集成Infinispan 和 JGroups，更容易搭建。

===========
Hibernate Search 4.4

Metadata API
need for OGM query integration
ease of development: log/dump the way things get indexed
Jandex annotation scanning
Dynamic sharding
Improve clustering: solid Infinispan and JGroups integration, ease of setup
(Google Summer of Code contributions)
New quickstart demo / JDF
(Google Summer of Code contributions)
More performance regression tests

===========
Hibernate Search 5.0

Migration to Apache Lucene 4.x
Expose uncommitted changes to queries in the current transaction
Explicit classloader SPI for better EAP integration as modules
Define API / SPI abstraction to allow for future external backends integrations (such as Apache Solr and Elastic Search)
Asynchronous FieldBridge (ex. improved Tika integration)
Integration with ORM's multitenancy API
(Google Summer of Code contributions)

===========
Hibernate Search 5.1

CDI integration?
High performance backend queues (low contention non blocking queues)
Automated performance regression tests
Infinispan 6.0
New Faceting engine
Auto suggestion and spell checking

===========
Hibernate Search 5.2

Pre-analysis of text in the transaction context (better remoting/clustering & scalability)
Hibernate 5.x / JPA 2.1 / JEE 7 (might need to be pushed earlier to match Hibernate 5 plans)
