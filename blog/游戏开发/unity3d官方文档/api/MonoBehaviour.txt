MonoBehaviour
http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html

Namespace: UnityEngine
Parent class: Behaviour

Description
MonoBehaviour is the base class every script derives from.
是所有脚本的基类。

Using Javascript every script automatically derives from MonoBehaviour. 
When using C# or Boo you have to explicitly derive from MonoBehaviour.

Note: The checkbox for disabling a MonoBehavior (on the editor) will only prevent Start(), Awake(), Update(), FixedUpdate(), and OnGUI() from executing. 
If none of these functions are present, the checkbox is not displayed.
在编辑器，可以通过复选框禁用上述函数。
