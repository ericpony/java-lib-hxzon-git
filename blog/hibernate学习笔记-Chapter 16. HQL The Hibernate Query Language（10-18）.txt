===================================
16.10. Expressions

Expressions used in the where clause include the following:

mathematical operators: +, -, *, /
binary comparison operators: =, >=, <=, <>, !=, like
logical operations and, or, not
Parentheses ( ) that indicates grouping
in, not in, between, is null, is not null, is empty, is not empty, member of and not member of
"Simple" case, case ... when ... then ... else ... end, and "searched" case,case when ... then ... else ... end
string concatenation ...||... or concat(...,...)
current_date(), current_time(), and current_timestamp()
second(...), minute(...), hour(...), day(...), month(...), and year(...)
Any function or operator defined by EJB-QL 3.0:substring(), trim(), lower(), upper(), length(), locate(), abs(), sqrt(), bit_length(), mod()
coalesce() and nullif()
str() for converting numeric or temporal values to a readable string
cast(... as ...), where the second argument is the name of a Hibernate type, andextract(... from ...) if ANSI cast() and extract() is supported by the underlying database
the HQL index() function, that applies to aliases of a joined indexed collection
HQL functions that take collection-valued path expressions:size(), minelement(), maxelement(), minindex(), maxindex(), along with the special elements() and indicesfunctions that can be quantified using some, all, exists, any, in.
Any database-supported SQL scalar function like sign(), trunc(), rtrim(), and sin()
JDBC-style positional parameters ?
named parameters :name, :start_date, and :x1
SQL literals 'foo', 69, 6.66E+2, '1970-01-01 10:00:01.0'
Java public static final constants eg.Color.TABBY
in and between can be used as follows:

from DomesticCat cat where cat.name between 'A' and 'B'
from DomesticCat cat where cat.name in ( 'Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz' )
The negated forms can be written as follows:

from DomesticCat cat where cat.name not between 'A' and 'B'
from DomesticCat cat where cat.name not in ( 'Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz' )
Similarly, is null and is not null can be used to test for null values.

Booleans can be easily used in expressions by declaring HQL query substitutions in Hibernate configuration:

<property name="hibernate.query.substitutions">true 1, false 0</property>


This will replace the keywords true and false with the literals 1 and 0 in the translated SQL from this HQL:

from Cat cat where cat.alive = true


You can test the size of a collection with the special property size or the special size() function.
你可以使用size或size()来测试一个集合。

from Cat cat where cat.kittens.size > 0
from Cat cat where size(cat.kittens) > 0

For indexed collections, you can refer to the minimum and maximum indices using minindex and maxindex functions. 
Similarly, you can refer to the minimum and maximum elements of a collection of basic type using the minelement and maxelement functions. 
For example:
你可以使用minindex和maxindex来引用集合中的最小值和最大值。
类似的，你也可以使用minelement和maxelement函数来引用集合中的最大值和最小值。

from Calendar cal where maxelement(cal.holidays) > current_date

from Order order where maxindex(order.items) > 100

from Order order where minelement(order.items) > 10000

The SQL functions any, some, all, exists, in are supported when passed the element or index set of a collection (elements and indices functions) or the result of a subquery (see below):

select mother from Cat as mother, Cat as kit
where kit in elements(foo.kittens)

select p from NameList list, Person p
where p.name = some elements(list.names)

from Cat cat where exists elements(cat.kittens)

from Player p where 3 > all elements(p.scores)

from Show show where 'fizard' in indices(show.acts)

Note that these constructs - size, elements, indices, minindex, maxindex, minelement, maxelement - can only be used in the where clause in Hibernate3.
注意，这些结构在hibernate3中只能用于where子句。

Elements of indexed collections (arrays, lists, and maps) can be referred to by index in a where clause only:


from Order order where order.items[0].id = 1234

select person from Person person, Calendar calendar
where calendar.holidays['national day'] = person.birthDay
    and person.nationality.calendar = calendar

select item from Item item, Order order
where order.items[ order.deliveredItemIndices[0] ] = item and order.id = 11

select item from Item item, Order order
where order.items[ maxindex(order.items) ] = item and order.id = 11

The expression inside [] can even be an arithmetic expression:
[]里的表达式可以使用数学运算。

select item from Item item, Order order
where order.items[ size(order.items) - 1 ] = item

HQL also provides the built-in index() function for elements of a one-to-many association or collection of values.


select item, index(item) from Order order
    join order.items item
where index(item) < 5

Scalar SQL functions supported by the underlying database can be used:

from DomesticCat cat where upper(cat.name) like 'FRI%'

Consider how much longer and less readable the following query would be in SQL:

select cust
from Product prod,
    Store store
    inner join store.customers cust
where prod.name = 'widget'
    and store.location.name in ( 'Melbourne', 'Sydney' )
    and prod = all elements(cust.currentOrder.lineItems)

Hint: something like

SELECT cust.name, cust.address, cust.phone, cust.id, cust.current_order
FROM customers cust,
    stores store,
    locations loc,
    store_customers sc,
    product prod
WHERE prod.name = 'widget'
    AND store.loc_id = loc.id
    AND loc.name IN ( 'Melbourne', 'Sydney' )
    AND sc.store_id = store.id
    AND sc.cust_id = cust.id
    AND prod.id = ALL(
        SELECT item.prod_id
        FROM line_items item, orders o
        WHERE item.order_id = o.id
            AND cust.current_order = o.id
    )

===========================
16.11. The order by clause

The list returned by a query can be ordered by any property of a returned class or components:
返回的列表可以使用任意字段排序。

from DomesticCat cat
order by cat.name asc, cat.weight desc, cat.birthdate

The optional asc or desc indicate ascending or descending order respectively.
可选的asc和desc关键字用来指定升序或降序。

===========================
16.12. The group by clause

A query that returns aggregate values can be grouped by any property of a returned class or components:
返回聚集值的查询可以使用任意字段分组。

select cat.color, sum(cat.weight), count(cat)
from Cat cat
group by cat.color


select foo.id, avg(name), max(name)
from Foo foo join foo.names name
group by foo.id


A having clause is also allowed.
支持having子句。

select cat.color, sum(cat.weight), count(cat)
from Cat cat
group by cat.color
having cat.color in (eg.Color.TABBY, eg.Color.BLACK)


SQL functions and aggregate functions are allowed in the having and order by clauses if they are supported by the underlying database (i.e., not in MySQL).
having子句和order by子句允许使用sql函数和聚集函数，加入底层数据库支持。


select cat
from Cat cat
    join cat.kittens kitten
group by cat.id, cat.name, cat.other, cat.properties
having avg(kitten.weight) > 100
order by count(kitten) asc, sum(kitten.weight) desc


Neither the group by clause nor the order by clause can contain arithmetic expressions. 
Hibernate also does not currently expand a grouped entity, so you cannot write group by cat if all properties of cat are non-aggregated. 
You have to list all non-aggregated properties explicitly.
分组子句和排序子句都不允许使用数学运算。
hibernate不扩展被分组的实体，所以如果cat的所有字段都是非聚集字段，你不能使用group by cat。
你必须显示的列出所有非聚集字段。

=========================
16.13. Subqueries
子查询。


For databases that support subselects, Hibernate supports subqueries within queries. 
A subquery must be surrounded by parentheses (often by an SQL aggregate function call). 
Even correlated subqueries (subqueries that refer to an alias in the outer query) are allowed.

from Cat as fatcat
where fatcat.weight > (
    select avg(cat.weight) from DomesticCat cat
)


from DomesticCat as cat
where cat.name = some (
    select name.nickName from Name as name
)


from Cat as cat
where not exists (
    from Cat as mate where mate.mate = cat
)


from DomesticCat as cat
where cat.name not in (
    select name.nickName from Name as name
)

select cat.id, (select max(kit.weight) from cat.kitten kit)
from Cat as cat


Note that HQL subqueries can occur only in the select or where clauses.
注意，hql子查询只允许出现在select子句或where子句。


Note that subqueries can also utilize row value constructor syntax. See Section 16.18, “Row value constructor syntax” for more information.

================================
16.14. HQL examples

Hibernate queries can be quite powerful and complex. 
In fact, the power of the query language is one of Hibernate's main strengths. 
The following example queries are similar to queries that have been used on recent projects. 
Please note that most queries you will write will be much simpler than the following examples.

The following query returns the order id, number of items, the given minimum total value and the total value of the order for all unpaid orders for a particular customer. 
The results are ordered by total value. 
In determining the prices, it uses the current catalog. 
The resulting SQL query, against the ORDER,ORDER_LINE, PRODUCT, CATALOG and PRICE tables has four inner joins and an (uncorrelated) subselect.

select order.id, sum(price.amount), count(item)
from Order as order
    join order.lineItems as item
    join item.product as product,
    Catalog as catalog
    join catalog.prices as price
where order.paid = false
    and order.customer = :customer
    and price.product = product
    and catalog.effectiveDate < sysdate
    and catalog.effectiveDate >= all (
        select cat.effectiveDate
        from Catalog as cat
        where cat.effectiveDate < sysdate
    )
group by order
having sum(price.amount) > :minAmount
order by sum(price.amount) desc


What a monster! Actually, in real life, I'm not very keen on subqueries, so my query was really more like this:

select order.id, sum(price.amount), count(item)
from Order as order
    join order.lineItems as item
    join item.product as product,
    Catalog as catalog
    join catalog.prices as price
where order.paid = false
    and order.customer = :customer
    and price.product = product
    and catalog = :currentCatalog
group by order
having sum(price.amount) > :minAmount
order by sum(price.amount) desc


The next query counts the number of payments in each status, excluding all payments in the AWAITING_APPROVAL status where the most recent status change was made by the current user. 
It translates to an SQL query with two inner joins and a correlated subselect against the PAYMENT,PAYMENT_STATUS and PAYMENT_STATUS_CHANGE tables.

select count(payment), status.name
from Payment as payment
    join payment.currentStatus as status
    join payment.statusChanges as statusChange
where payment.status.name <> PaymentStatus.AWAITING_APPROVAL
    or (
        statusChange.timeStamp = (
            select max(change.timeStamp)
            from PaymentStatusChange change
            where change.payment = payment
        )
        and statusChange.user <> :currentUser
    )
group by status.name, status.sortOrder
order by status.sortOrder


If the statusChanges collection was mapped as a list, instead of a set, the query would have been much simpler to write.


select count(payment), status.name
from Payment as payment
    join payment.currentStatus as status
where payment.status.name <> PaymentStatus.AWAITING_APPROVAL
    or payment.statusChanges[ maxIndex(payment.statusChanges) ].user <> :currentUser
group by status.name, status.sortOrder
order by status.sortOrder


The next query uses the MS SQL Server isNull() function to return all the accounts and unpaid payments for the organization to which the current user belongs. 
It translates to an SQL query with three inner joins, an outer join and a subselect against the ACCOUNT, PAYMENT, PAYMENT_STATUS, ACCOUNT_TYPE, ORGANIZATION and ORG_USER tables.

select account, payment
from Account as account
    left outer join account.payments as payment
where :currentUser in elements(account.holder.users)
    and PaymentStatus.UNPAID = isNull(payment.currentStatus.name, PaymentStatus.UNPAID)
order by account.type.sortOrder, account.accountNumber, payment.dueDate


For some databases, we would need to do away with the (correlated) subselect.

select account, payment
from Account as account
    join account.holder.users as user
    left outer join account.payments as payment
where :currentUser = user
    and PaymentStatus.UNPAID = isNull(payment.currentStatus.name, PaymentStatus.UNPAID)
order by account.type.sortOrder, account.accountNumber, payment.dueDate


===============================
16.15. Bulk update and delete
批量更新和删除。

HQL now supports update, delete and insert ... select ... statements. See Section 15.4, “DML-style operations” for more information.
hql现在支持update，delete和insert...select语句，参见15.4节。

===========================
16.16. Tips & Tricks
提示和技巧。


You can count the number of query results without returning them:

( (Integer) session.createQuery("select count(*) from ....").iterate().next() ).intValue()


To order a result by the size of a collection, use the following query:

select usr.id, usr.name
from User as usr
    left join usr.messages as msg
group by usr.id, usr.name
order by count(msg)


If your database supports subselects, you can place a condition upon selection size in the where clause of your query:

from User usr where size(usr.messages) >= 1


If your database does not support subselects, use the following query:

select usr.id, usr.name
from User usr
    join usr.messages msg
group by usr.id, usr.name
having count(msg) >= 1


As this solution cannot return a User with zero messages because of the inner join, the following form is also useful:

select usr.id, usr.name
from User as usr
    left join usr.messages as msg
group by usr.id, usr.name
having count(msg) = 0


Properties of a JavaBean can be bound to named query parameters:
javahean的属性能够用来为命名语句提供参数。

Query q = s.createQuery("from foo Foo as foo where foo.name=:name and foo.size=:size");
q.setProperties(fooBean); // fooBean has getName() and getSize()
List foos = q.list();


Collections are pageable by using the Query interface with a filter:
可以使用filter来为集合分页。

Query q = s.createFilter( collection, "" ); // the trivial filter
q.setMaxResults(PAGE_SIZE);
q.setFirstResult(PAGE_SIZE * pageNumber);
List page = q.list();


Collection elements can be ordered or grouped using a query filter:
集合也能够通过filter来排序或分组。


Collection orderedCollection = s.filter( collection, "order by this.amount" );
Collection counts = s.filter( collection, "select this.type, count(this) group by this.type" );

You can find the size of a collection without initializing it:
你通过select count(*)可以直接获得一个集合的大小而不用加载它。

( (Integer) session.createQuery("select count(*) from ....").iterate().next() ).intValue();


=================================
16.17. Components
组件。

Components can be used similarly to the simple value types that are used in HQL queries. 
They can appear in the select clause as follows:

select p.name from Person p

select p.name.first from Person p

where the Person's name property is a component. 
Components can also be used in the where clause:

from Person p where p.name = :name

from Person p where p.name.first = :firstName

Components can also be used in the order by clause:

from Person p order by p.name

from Person p order by p.name.first

Another common use of components is in Section 16.18, “Row value constructor syntax”.

===================================
16.18. Row value constructor syntax


HQL supports the use of ANSI SQL row value constructor syntax, sometimes referred to AS tuple syntax, even though the underlying database may not support that notion. 
hql支持元组，即使底层数据库不支持。

Here, we are generally referring to multi-valued comparisons, typically associated with components. 
Consider an entity Person which defines a name component:

from Person p where p.name.first='John' and p.name.last='Jingleheimer-Schmidt'

That is valid syntax although it is a little verbose. 
You can make this more concise by using row value constructor syntax:
上面的语法有点累赘，你可以使用元组让它更简洁，见如下例子。

from Person p where p.name=('John', 'Jingleheimer-Schmidt')

It can also be useful to specify this in the select clause:

select p.name from Person p

Using row value constructor syntax can also be beneficial when using subqueries that need to compare against multiple values:

from Cat as cat
where not ( cat.name, cat.color ) in (
    select cat.name, cat.color from DomesticCat cat
)

One thing to consider when deciding if you want to use this syntax, is that the query will be dependent upon the ordering of the component sub-properties in the metadata.
当你使用元组语法时，有一件事需考虑，那就是查询是否依赖于组件的子字段的顺序。
