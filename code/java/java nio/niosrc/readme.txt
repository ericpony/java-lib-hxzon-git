Java NIO Book - Example Code

The files in this area are the example code from the NIO book. There is additional code here which is not a part of the book. Some is throw-away code I used to check things, some of it tickles bugs in the 1.4.0 JDK distribution.

At this level is a JAR file which contains everything. The "unpacked" directory is the content of the JAR for your browsing convenience.

The nioexamples JAR (one level down) contains the compiled classes.

All code here is copyright by me. It is provided for demonstration purposes only and may not be used in a commercial application without my prior consent. No warranties, express or implied.
