NIO Server Framework

Files here are related to the prototype multiplexed NIO server framework that I've presented at JavaOne and SD West.

The zip file contains the source code, including a couple of simple apps. This code is for educational purposes. It has not been seriously tested and is not guaranteed to be bug-free. It is, however, derived from an earlier NIO framework (protoplex) that has been in large scale production for several years, so the core design is sound and can be used as a foundation for a fully functional framework.

This is a convenience snapshot of the code. You can fetch the current code from the Subversion repository with the following command:

svn co svn://javanio.info/protoplex
This repository contains both the NIO sample server and the complete protoplex framework. Protoplex predates JDK 1.5 and has a slightly different design, but is complete and production-ready.

The code for both NIO Server and Protoplex is open source under the Apache 2.0 license. You may use it in compliance with that license but I would appreciate if you contact me if you plan to use it for anything beyond tinkering. Contact me at: ron_AT_ronsoft.com
