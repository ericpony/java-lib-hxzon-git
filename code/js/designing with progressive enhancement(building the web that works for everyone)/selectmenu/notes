- tabindex needs to transfer from select (if set)
- label click directs focus to button
- replace button markup
- replace menu markup
- menu hidden style needs display none (not block)
- li.selected and li.hover backgrounds should apply to LI not a
- li text should go in anchor, not li
- reappend menu to body
- button not menubutton
- we don't style the button icon ever
- in custom select, we should make the point that we only care about text value of options
- switch case syntax is wrong (:)
- bind click to document to hide select
- button icon has 2 spans (now called button icon)
- status has icon span too
- should we set height? overflow auto on menu, set heights


- only thing not built-in yet is type-ahead


- should we hide with display: none??
