An Introduction and Tutorial for Common Lisp
http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/lisp.html


This document provides a small set of resources and references on Common Lisp. 
It was originally prepared for students in the Part-Time MS Program in Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University. 
Most of this document was written 10+ years ago, 
since much of my time is now spent doing Java and Ajax work. 
Nevertheless, please send corrections/suggestions to Marty Hall (hall@jhu.edu). 
The original of this document is at http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/lisp.html. 
Also see the Belorussian version of the tutorial, translated by Paul Bukhovko and provided by fatcow.
Note that some of the documents are in PostScript. 
If your WWW browser cannot display PostScript, they can still be saved and printed.

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0805347801/martyhallsrecommA/
If you want a good AI book that includes some coverage of Lisp and Prolog, this is the one for you.

《Artificial Intelligence by Patrick Henry Winston.》
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0201533774/martyhallsrecomm/
The classic reference. A bit heavy on the topic of learning.

---- 
Java and Web Programming.

OK, ok, so these don't have anything to do with Lisp. 
But I couldn't resist.

Capturing the results of an interactive Lisp session. 
http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/lisp/Capturing-Output.text
I.e. how to save the results of testing to file. 
This gives Lisp-specific (dribble), UNIX-specific (script), and emacs-specific methods. 
In all cases, use of the Show-Output macro will make it easier to save the test cases.

http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/lisp/Hanoi.lisp

A Common Lisp implementation of the N-Queens problem. 
http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/lisp/N-Queens.lisp
Finds a solution to the N-Queens problem for any N 4 or greater. 
The solution can be found in linear time (constant time per queen), 
although printing out the board takes O(N^2) time. 
But no search is involved. 
If you have a Java enabled browser, 
visit http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/NQueens.html to see an interactive version of this in Java.

Issues for Intermediate/Advanced Lisp Programmers

An introduction to some higher-order Common Lisp functions. Higher-order functions are ones that use other functions as arguments. Passing functions around in Lisp is one of its distinctive features. Also available in PostScript.
A macro called Show-Output that lets you save test cases. Using Show-Output is not at all difficult: you just supply Lisp forms and each form is printed out along with the return value of the form. But writing it requires a basic understanding of Lisp macros.
Some hints on benchmarking Lisp code (PostScript).
A set of simple timing/metering functions in Common Lisp.
Destructive operations and list performance. Also available in PostScript.
An introduction to Common Lisp macros. Macros are forms that generate Lisp code. Also available in PostScript.
Guide to good Lisp style (PostScript). From Peter Norvig and Kent Pittman's LUV-93 tutorial.
Jeff Dalton's list of Common Lisp pitfalls. Most are for the advanced user.
VT100 cursor control from Lisp.

CLOS

CLOS is the "Common Lisp Object System", a powerful OOP package built into Common Lisp.
A thumbnail summary of CLOS. Also available as a one-page PostScript file.
Introductory CLOS lecture notes. Also available in PostScript.
Common CLOS Blunders (PostScript).
Some details on defclass. Also available in PostScript.
Some details on defgeneric. Also available in PostScript.
A simplified interface to defclass. The Def-Class macro lets you type
(Def-Class Class (Parents)
  (Slot-1 Val-1)
  (Slot-2 Val-2)
  Slot-3)
and get the effect of
(defclass Class (Parents)
  ((Slot-1 :initform Val-1 :accessor Slot-1 :initarg :Slot-1)
   (Slot-2 :initform Val-2 :accessor Slot-2 :initarg :Slot-2)
   (Slot-3                 :accessor Slot-3 :initarg :Slot-3)))
The Define-Class macro has identical syntax to Def-Class, but it also adds a unique name slot and does some bookkeeping to keep track of instances. It supports Instances to get objects of the given class, Direct-Instances to get objects of the given class but not of a subclass, and several other bookkeeping routines.
Optimizations in the Symbolics CLOS Implementations. A paper by D. Scott Cyphers and David Moon showing how CLOS could be implemented efficiently.

Internet Lisp Resources

A free Common Lisp for Windows. This is a version of the popular commercial Allegro Common Lisp for Windows, with some limitations such as limited heap size, no foreign function support, no compile-file, no disassembler, and no image saving (save-image). However, compile is still available and files get compiled as they are loaded (you just can't save the compiled version to disk). Otherwise this is the same version as their commercial implementation. An excellent choice for students with Windows machines at home, and includes an interactive tutorial. This page also allows downloading of a free evaluation copy of Allegro CL for UNIX. Also see the Franz Web Site for more info on this offering.
Another free Common Lisp for Windows. From Harlequin, Inc., makers of the UNIX LispWorks environment, this is a more limited implementation formerly only for academic use. No compiler.
A limited-time use evaluation copy of Macintosh Common Lisp 4.0. From Digitool.
Pointers to other free Common Lisps available on the Net for UNIX, VMS, DOS/Windows, and Macintosh. Extracted from version 1.48 of the FAQ for comp.lang.lisp. See there for the latest details.
Lecture notes, handouts, and some exercises from Marty Hall's AI Programming class in the Hopkins part-time MS program in CS.

The comp.lang.lisp Usenet newsgroup. You may want to use a newsreader like nn or gnus instead of a WWW browser if you really subscribe to it.
Collection of job postings for Lisp-related positions. Most of these jobs come from the Lisp-Jobs mailing list of Mark Kantrowitz (send "help" in the body) or the comp.lang.lisp Usenet group. This collection is in UNIX mailbox format, so to peruse you probably want to download it and read it with your favorite mailreader. It also includes AI-related jobs that don't necessarily mention Lisp if they are in the greater Baltimore/Washington area. For complete archives of the Lisp-Jobs and AI-Jobs mailing lists, see the archives at CMU.
